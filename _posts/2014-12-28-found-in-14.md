Looking back on 2014 there were several new products and services that I started using that will definitely be fixtures into 2015 and beyond.  My two favorites this year revolved around both time and cost savings.

##Waze

Probably my favorite and most used app of the year has been [Waze](https://www.waze.com/).  If you aren't familiar with it, it is a GPS map and traffic app that is crowd sourced.  Many of the map apps now show and take into account the local traffic.  But Waze includes so much more.  As you drive you can report anything from traffic jams, accidents, and lane closures to hidden police, missing signs, and gas prices.  So you can be warned about that bone jarring pot hole long before you slam into it.  In addition to avoiding the slow routes it can also help avoid costly mistakes by pointing out where the gas is cheapest and where that speed trap is hidden.  Of course it has requisite gamification to get you hooked.  You can track your progress against your Facebook friends and even the rest of your state.  I'm now in the top 1% in my state (so my avatar gets a little crown).  Waze was purchased by Google in 2013 and [could be bundled on your next Android phone](http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/3/8140389/waze-google-mobile-apps-android).

##Ting

Have you tried calling your cell carrier and ended up on hold for 20 or more minutes?  [Ting](https://zcer1t2h9n7.ting.com/) is trying to make that a thing of the past.  When you call their support number a human answers on the first ring!  Occasionally there are events that trigger unusually high call volumes and they [actually apologize for not answering right away](https://ting.com/blog/why-isnt-ting-picking-up-right-away-when-i-call/).  Have you ever received a sincere apology from AT&T or Verizon?  Ting is also significantly cheaper than other carriers.  We are saving over $80/month over Sprint.  This is because Ting only charges for what you use.  There is a reasonable $6 charge per phone then everything else is paid per minute/MB/text.  So there is no nonsense with rollover minutes or data stashing since you aren't deciding up front what the limit of your usage should be.  They also don't offer subsidized phones that you end up paying for over the course of a two year contract.  You can bring your own device (BYOD) or buy a reguarly priced phone through them.

Ting isn't all unicorns and rainbows.  There are two downsides.  First, they are an [MVNO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_virtual_network_operator) which means they don't have their own mobile infrastructure.  They use Sprint's network for CDMA and other networks for GSM coverage.  Second, part of their agreement with Sprint limits how soon new devices can be brought over.  This means you can't buy the latest and greatest phone through Sprint and then immediately move it to Ting.  Typically there is a one year wait before new models can be moved.

This [referral link](https://zcer1t2h9n7.ting.com/) is good for $25 credit for both of us.
