<h3>"Success is never owned; it is only rented â€“ and the rent is due every day." - Rory Vaden</h3><br>

<p>What would you like to know about me?  Like everyone else, I can be tagged in many ways.
I'm a father, husband, brother, sports fan, coach, devops engineer and developer.</p>

<p>I am the Chief Information Officer at <a href="http://www.wingspan.com/">Wingspan Technology, Inc.</a>
Most of my professional career has been spent slinging code and solving technical problems.
Now I've moved over to the operations side of the house.  So I'm writing less code but learning a lot of new technologies.</p>

<p>This site will lean toward the technical but will stray into the random as the mood hits me.</p>
