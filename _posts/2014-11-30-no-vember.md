This November I grew a beard.  I just don't like shaving and decided to be lazy and hairy for a month.  It is only a matter of time before the annoyance of having a beard outweighs the hassle of shaving.  I was asked several times a week about the charitable cause that I was not shaving for since November has become man's follow up to the October breast cancer pinkwashing.

It technically wasn't a "No Shave November" since I shaved on November 1st and then again on Thanksgiving.  Four weeks is about as long as I can go before the facial hair novelty wears off.  It also wasn't for any particular cause.  Not [Movember](http://us.movember.com/) nor [No Shave November](http://www.no-shave.org/).  It was simply a No-vember. 

I get the Hunt for Pink October and Hairy November.  Having a fund raising gimic makes a lot of sense from the charity's perspective.  Just look at the ALS Association's [Ice Bucket Challenge](http://www.alsa.org/news/media/press-releases/ice-bucket-challenge-082914.html).  This summer that raised **$100.9 million** in donations compared to $2.8 million during the same time period last year.  I doubt the majority of the participants could tell you anything more about ALS than before their ice dumping but you can't argue with the monetary results.

Many of these fundraising events also make sense from the participants perspective.  There is no way that walking 60 miles over the course of [three days](http://www.the3day.org/) isn't going to generate comradery and sense of community that carries beyond those three days.  Growing facial hair or dumping a bucket of ice on yourself aren't as extreme but I guess they could have similiar if lesser results.

What makes less sense is why those people that donate to these causes only do it when someone they know is causing themself discomfort.  Some will just be supporting a friend, family member, co-worker, etc. regardless of the cause.  Others might truely believe in the cause but not able to participate themselves.  Maybe some are indifferent to the cause but looking for charities to donate to.  In this case selecting one that someone you know is involved with isn't the worst way to pick a charity.  It also isn't the best way.

Anytime you are donating your hard earned money you should be sure it is actually going to the advertised cause and not just lining the pockets of highly paid executives.  There are tons of poorly run or sham organizations out there.  Luckily there are also several charity watchdogs to assist in the research.  [Charity Navigator](http://www.charitynavigator.org/), [CharityWatch](https://www.charitywatch.org/home), and the [BBB Wise Giving Alliance](http://give.org/) all provide ratings for national charities.  They each use slightly different criteria so a 3 star rating on one might be a D rating on another.  Small local charities are less likely to be listed on these sites.  However you should be able to retrieve an organization's [IRS Form 900](http://www.guidestar.org/rxg/help/faqs/form-990/index.aspx) from [GuideStar](http://www.guidestar.org/).  This will at least verify that the organization is legitimate with some basic financial information.

Whatever your cause and your reason for donating, just make sure it is an educated decision.  There are almost always multiple charities to choose from regardless of the cause.  So why not make sure your money is going where it will be best spent.
